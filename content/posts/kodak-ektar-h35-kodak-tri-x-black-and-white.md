I can't believe how good these turned out. Of all the film + camera combos I shot this summer, **Kodak Tri-X** in the **Ektar half frame** are my favorite. 

Is black and white just magic or something? I put b/w through my Canon AT-1 and didn't get anything like this (granted, the film was expired...) but seriously, whatever this camera + film combo is doing, it's working for me. Ordinary moments became bold and dramatic!

My favorite pic, but perhaps a bit harsh with the contrast. Reminds me of old tabloid photos. Just gotta Photoshop a UFO over the plane.

Classic cars are meant for film.

All photos shown here were developed by [The Darkroom](thedarkroom.com) in California. I highly recommend them. 

I look forward to shooting this particular camera and film combo again very soon!
