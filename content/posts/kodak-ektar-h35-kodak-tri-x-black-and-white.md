Here are the results of my first roll of Tri-X black and white film shot with the Kodak Ektar H35, a small form-factor film camera that shoots 72 photos on a 36-shot roll of film by only filling half the frame with each photo taken. 

All previous rolls I shot with the half frame were color, and I was surprised at how bold and contrasty these photos turned out. These relatively mundane moments became bold and dramatic!

My favorite pic, but perhaps a bit harsh with the contrast. Reminds me of old tabloid photos. Imagine the plane is a UFO :)

Classic cars are meant for film.

All photos shown here were developed by [The Darkroom](thedarkroom.com) in California. I highly recommend them. My previous experiments with black and white film (Tri-X 400, specifically), were all in my Canon AT-1 and turned out rather gray and lacking in dark blacks and bright whites. 

I look forward to shooting this particular camera and film combo again very soon!
