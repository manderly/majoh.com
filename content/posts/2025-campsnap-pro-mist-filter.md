One of the best things about the CampSnap Pro is you can attach a threaded filter to it and get a cool, most customized effect on your photos. 

Here is the exact filter I purchased in November 2025 and shot these photos with: [Walking Way 37mm Soft Focus Filter](https://amzn.to/48WovIb) This filter creates a very soft and dreamy effect that I found very fun to experiment with. Be sure to get it in 37mm size if you intend to put it on a CampSnap Pro.

## Mist filter review

The mist filter is very easy to use. It screws on over the lens like so:

You can also attach a lens cap _on top of_ the filter:

[This link](https://amzn.to/48XX0Oz) goes to the lens cap pictured here that I use on my CampSnap Pro. Be sure to get it in 37mm, whether you plan to put it directly on your CampSnap Pro or stack it on top of a filter.

I really like the results I get with the mist filter. It's not for every situation, but the soft bloom adds interest and softens the end result into something that doesn't feel so sharp the way digital photos tend to look. This was my first time shooting photos with any kind of filter, so now I'm curious to see what else is out there and possibly bring this same effect into some of my film photography.
