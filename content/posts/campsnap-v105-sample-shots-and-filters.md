I picked up a CampSnap on a whim and thought it would be a cool toy, but it quickly became part of my everyday bag. It's fun. You shoot without worrying about perfection. Like film, you get to be pleasantly surprised later when you review the pics at home. You live in suspense until then, wondering if you got the shot. 

The filters are fun, too. Some of them even look sorta halfway like the film photos I remember from my childhood. 

I mostly shot with whatever the fine people over at r/campsnap were sharing, but I also tried making my own. 

## Sample photos: CampSnap v105 summer 2025
All images straight out of camera. Any flaws in composition are my own. :P 

"Expired" filter - from [campshades.com](https://www.campshades.com/shop/essentials-collection)

I also tried my hand at creating my own filter, which I named "Memorare" after one of my favorite songs by The Cruxshadows. I was aiming for "warm" and got "pink", but I like it, and I enjoyed the experimentation.

**Thoughts on the CampSnap V105**

I actually love it. It's not as expensive (and the turnaround is faster) compared with film, but the lack of a screen on the back makes it much easier to shoot without getting distracted. The camera is rugged and fits easily in my purse and into the bag on my bike. 

You get to be a little spontaneous - and a little fearless - with a CampSnap in your hands. 

**Memorare.flt CampSnap v105 filter**

Here's my warm and dark filter for those who want to try it, too - totally free. Enjoy! 

To use: create a new text file, paste these numbers into it, name it memorare.flt, and put it in the root directory of your CampSnap v105.
