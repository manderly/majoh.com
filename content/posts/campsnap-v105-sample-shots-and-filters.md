I picked up a CampSnap on a whim and thought it would be a cool toy, but it quickly became part of my everyday bag. It's fun. You shoot without worrying about perfection. You get to be pleasantly surprised later when you load the photos onto your computer.

The filters are fun, too. I mostly shot with whatever the fine people over at r/campsnap were sharing, but I also tried making my own. 

## Sample photos: CampSnap v105 summer 2025
All images straight out of camera. Any flaws in composition are my own. :P 

"Expired" filter - from [campshades.com](https://www.campshades.com/shop/essentials-collection)

I also tried my hand at creating my own filter, which I named "Memorare" after one of my favorite songs by The Cruxshadows. I was aiming for "warm" and got "pink", but I like it, and I enjoyed the experimentation.

Filter for those who want to try it, too:

You have to be a little spontaneous and a little fearless with a CampSnap in your hands.
