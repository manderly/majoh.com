Disposable cameras are bulkier than your phone, cost more to develop than an ordinary roll of film, and don't even have the decency to let you know your finger is in the shot. 

Despite all these drawbacks, the humble disposable camera still has something unique to offer: the shots they produce are unreplicateable and have an uncanny resemblance to the photos of my own 80s/90s childhood.

**Camera:** [Fujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400 One-Time-Use Camera - amazon.com](https://amzn.to/42Bg8hK)

**Film:** Already inside!

I shot two Fujifilm disposable cameras over the spring/summer of 2025. I sent one camera to Walgreen's photo lab and one camera to [The Darkroom](https://thedarkroom.com). All sample pics are unedited, straight out of the camera.

Dawn at the local nature preserve - wow, this might be one of the nicest photos I've ever taken. It looks like a painting. (thedarkroom.com)

I love this photo, but the pink tint is inaccurate to the environment. I enjoy these imperfections of the film medium and accept them as part of the fun (Walgreens photo)

This one is almost indistinguishable from photos I took at various theme parks in the 1990s. (Walgreens photo)

**Who developed it better?**
Definitely [The Darkroom](https://thedarkroom.com), and I appreciate that they sent me my negatives back. Walgreens does not return your negatives, so you're stuck with whatever scans they produce. (For that reason alone I won't bring a disposable to Walgreens in the future even though they were significantly less expensive than The Darkroom. I strongly prefer having my negatives.)

**Thoughts on the experience**
Carrying a disposable camera for the first time in like 25 years was definitely different. I had to carry a larger bag than I would have otherwise, and I had to be mindful of its delicate lens. I've gotten very used to just whipping my phone out and taking candid shots, but with the disposable I found I had to be a lot more careful and deliberate.

The photos have an undeniable charm, though, and I find myself looking at them longer, and more often, than snapshots from my phone. There is something special and tangible about them.

**Where the camera (and I) struggled**

Indoor shots without flash were just pure grain and not worth posting here. 

Indoor shots with flash have a vintage look to them. However, I chose this shot to also demonstrate a shortcoming of the camera (and myself): the viewfinder does not show what the lens sees, and as a result, I had no idea I was sticking my finger in so many shots.

I like this shot, but something about either the camera or the development process was not ideal for the high contrast between the sky and the rest of the scene. My early morning shots (like this one) were not nearly as great as my midday shots.

This one makes up for it, though.

Overall, I loved the results. It wasn't a cheap experiment, though, so I ended up investing in a [Kodak Ektar H35](https://amzn.to/3J01D0e) to use going forward. This half-frame camera is a lot like a reusable disposable with the added advantage of taking 72 "half frame" pics instead of the standard "full frame" 36, so you get more photos out of each roll. I shot several more rolls of different film stocks on the half-frame over the course of 2025's summer (see the other posts on this blog).
